    <p>The <a href="https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf">POODLE attack</a> gained my attention, as it was disclosed some
time ago. An exploit has to act at different positions (victim browser, HTTP request generator and TLS proxy) in a
coordinated way and it includes an interesting bit of broken cryptography. Furthermore I asked myself, how practicable
this attack is and what the obstacles in buildung an exploit for it are. This writeup is about the experiences I have
made while developing a Proof of Concept script for POODLE testing it.</p>
<p>You can get the source code <a href="https://github.com/thomaspatzke/POODLEAttack">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>During my work other people released some Proof of Concept code of the POODLE attack. The projects can be found on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/EiNSTeiN-/poodle/blob/master/src/poodle.py">here</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mpgn/poodle-exploit">here</a>. As far as I can see, both do not implement the request generator that is
running inside the victims browser.</p>
<p>Many other people developed checks for the POODLE vulnerability. Most code checks for SSLv3 support with CBC cipher
usage. I <a href="https://github.com/thomaspatzke/PoodleCheck">wrote a check based on PolarSSL</a>, which checks the behavior of a
TLS/SSL server on broken padding. This can also be used to verify vulnerable TLS implementations.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The picture below gives a rough overview about of the implemented Proof of Concept code:</p>
<p><img alt="Overview of Implementation" src="./images/POODLE-Attack-Overview.svg"></p>
<p>The implemented parts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A request generator, that runs in the victims browser. This can be injected in web pages requested via
  HTTP and was implemeted as static JavaScript file (POODLEClient.js).</li>
<li>A HTTP server that serves the static request generator code and answers requests from the request generator regarding
  the parameters of the generated HTTPS requests to the attack target server. The Python module http.server was used
  here.</li>
<li>A TLS Proxy that modifies the intercepted TLS packets of the generated HTTPS requests and checks the response of the
  server for them. The module socketserver was used.</li>
<li>Some state has to be shared between TLS Proxy and HTTP server. Because both are running in different threads, the
  Python classes Manager and BaseManager from multiprocessing.managers were used to create object instances that are
  accessible from different threads and even remotely. Never used that before, nice Python feature :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>The implemetation itself follows the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf">description of the paper</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Degrade TLS protocol usage to SSLv3 by disruption of TLS handshake attempts.</li>
<li>Justify the URL and POST length such that the last block of the ciphertext is padding. This is done by increasing the
   POST body size by one byte until the cipher text extends by a block size.</li>
<li>Perform the copy operation on every generated TLS packet and calculate the leaked byte if the server accepts the
   modified packet.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are interested in the details, just read the really good paper linked above!</p>
<p>One obstacle I have encountered was, that the length of the POST body can unexpected influence the overall length
of the plain text by the <em>Content-Length</em> HTTP request header, when the length of the body drops below 10 (or
theoretically exceeds 100). This condition is circumvented by usage of body lengths of minimum 26 as start value. The
minimum POST length while phase 3 of the attack is then 10 when a 16 byte block is shifted to the first byte.</p>
<p>Another odd looking behaviour is, that the first TLS application data record only contains one plain text byte. This is
a <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/01/15/beastfollowup.html">countermeasure against exploitation of the BEAST
vulnerability</a>. To make things simple, the POODLE PoC only
handles application data records that exceed a certain size.</p>
<h2>Optimization Potential</h2>
<p>The PoC implementation of the attack is far from being optimal. Every generated request requires an additional HTTP
roundtrip to ask the HTTP server for the next requests parameters, even when the parameters change only after a
plaintext byte has leaked in the decryption phase.</p>
<h2>Test Environment</h2>
<p>The PoC is entirely written in Python 3.2. I developed and tested it on a recent version of Kali Linux.</p>
<p>Because my preferred browser, Firefox, is not vulnerable against POODLE in current versions, I have used the following
about:config parameters to get the vulnerability back for development and testing purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>security.tls.version.min = 0</code></li>
<li><code>security.tls.version.max = 0</code></li>
<li><code>security.tls.version.fallback-limit = 0</code></li>
<li><code>security.ssl3.*_rc4_* = false</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A script <em>TestHTTPServer.py</em> was created as attack target server. The SSLv3 listener was created with socat as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">socat</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">OPENSSL</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">LISTEN</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">4433</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">verify</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">method</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">SSLv3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">cert</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">cert</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">poodle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pem</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">key</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">poodle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pem</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">reuseaddr</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">fork</span> <span class="n">TCP</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">localhost</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">4080</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It forwards the received connections to the HTTP server. Usually the PoC script deduces the MitM config from the target
URL. The traffic has to be redirected by <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/632251/traffic-redirecting-with-linux-man-in-the-middle">appropriate iptables
rules</a> or similar. For testing the following command line
was used to avoid MitM hassle:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">poodle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span> <span class="c1">--target-port 4433 --start-offset 384 https://localhost:8443</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I have created a script <code>poodle-dev.sh</code>, that starts these components. Just run the following commands in different
terminals or as background jobs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">poodle</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="n">httpserver</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">poodle</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="n">sslserver</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">poodle</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="n">attacker</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">nodebug</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The attack is performed by requesting the URL <code>http://localhost:8000</code> from a vulnerable browser. No user interaction is
required, as long as the page remains open somewhere in the browser. Do not forget to accept the test certificates (in
the demo environment at <a href="https://localhost:8443">https://localhost:8443</a>) in your browser before you start. XMLHttpRequests will fail elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is how an attack looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ./poodle.py --target-port <span class="m">4433</span> --start-offset <span class="m">384</span> https://localhost:8443

<h2>Observations</h2>
<h3>Attack Performance</h3>
<p>I performed several runs in the above local test environment and measured the time to succesfully leak 8 bytes. The
minimum was 240 seconds, most attempts took 300 seconds or longer. As mentioned above, there is some improvement
potential for the PoC, but in reality an attacker would not have the performance of a loopback network device
;-)</p>
<h3>Exploitability of Current Browser Versions</h3>
<p>Current versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome are safe. They reject to connect with SSLv3 when TLS failed
previously. Internet Explorer 11 starts with TLSv1.2 but allows degradation to SSLv3 by connection interruption.</p>
<h3>Detection of the Attack</h3>
<p>The traffic that occurs is quite unusual. The following suspisious properties can be observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The termination of attempts to communicate with TLS 1.0 and higher.</li>
<li>Cipher texts with two same blocks.</li>
<li>A huge amount of HTTPS requests, that are terminated with an encrypted TLS alert message before a response can be
  sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: POODLE attack attempts are detectible at network layer.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It is quite simple: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-sslv3-diediedie-02">SSLv3 must die!</a>. The protocol was
superseded in 1999 by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2246">TLSv1.0</a>. Browsers that rely on it due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#browsersTSL">lack of support
for TLS</a> are IE6 or Opera 4. Whoever still uses this
browsers, has much more security issues than POODLE. Keeping SSLv3 enabled for customers that use these browsers means that
the security of users with newer browsers is degraded.</p>
<p>Simply: disable it.</p>
<p>When offering websites via insecure HTTP it is possible for a MitM
attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages, which is
required for the POODLE attack (request generator). Therefore the usage
of insecure HTTP should be reduced as much as possible. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME">CRIME</a> is another
vulnerability that requires the attackers code to be executed in the victims browser.</p>
